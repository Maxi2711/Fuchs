FuchsBot is going to be the worlds most advanced discord bot, offering numerous features in terms of moderating and running a discord server.

I aim to combine most of the major bots into one single bot, with advanced customization and custom commands.

Currently I am working on implementing the back end for the bot. I want to make it easily expandable and maintainable.



The bots interface will differ wildly from the other bots, because I am not going to make webtools for it (atleast at the moment). Every interaction will for now be only through discord itself, either through private messages or through the server in question itself.
